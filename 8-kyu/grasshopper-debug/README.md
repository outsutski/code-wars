Unfortunately his code has some bugs.</p><p>Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.</p><p>To convert fahrenheit to celsius:</p><pre><code>celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)</code></pre><p>Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given in whole numbers. It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures with a higher accuracy such as to the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types of temperature measuring sensors. </p>
